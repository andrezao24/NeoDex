NeoDex was a project I developed as part of my learning journey with the React library. 
It is a reimagined and enhanced version of the traditional Pokédex, designed to go beyond basic functionality by offering a range of additional features that improve usability, interactivity, and overall user experience.

The project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, which allowed me to gain hands-on experience with component-based architecture, state management, and the creation of dynamic, responsive web applications. 
Through this project, I was able to deepen my understanding of modern front-end development practices while applying creative solutions to real-world design challenges.
